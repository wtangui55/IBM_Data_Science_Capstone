# IBM Data Science Capstone: Web Scraping Falcon 9 Launch Data

In this comprehensive capstone project, I applied a data science approach to predict SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings. The project spanned from data acquisition through web scraping to predictive modeling, providing a thorough analysis of launch success factors.

## Project Scope
- The objective was to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings based on historical launch data.
- Utilized web scraping to gather data directly from SpaceX's API and other relevant sources.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Retrieved launch records using SpaceX API and web scraping techniques.
- **Data Wrangling**: Transformed raw data into a clean format suitable for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed an in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to better understand the launch outcomes.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Applied classification models to predict landing outcomes.
- **Model Tuning and Evaluation**: Conducted hyperparameter tuning and evaluated model performance.

## Key Insights
- Identified key factors influencing landing success, such as payload mass and launch site.
- Revealed the impact of booster version and reusability on mission success rates.

## Implications
- Provided actionable insights that can aid in improving the cost-efficiency of future launches.
- Highlighted the importance of machine learning in advancing the success of space missions.

## Conclusion
The project not only enhanced my expertise in data science techniques but also contributed to the field of space exploration by predicting landing outcomes, a crucial aspect of reusable rocket technology.
